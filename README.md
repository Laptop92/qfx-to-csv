# qfx-to-csv
 Given a QFX file, returns a CSV file with one row per transaction. I used QFX files generated by [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/), and this converter might be overspecialized to their format.
 
 To use, place a QFX file in the src directory and run qfx-to-csv.py. A CSV file will be created in the same directory, whose name is the same as the QFX file but with the .csv extension.
